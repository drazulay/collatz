# collatz
A simple collatz sequence generator implemented as a generator.

[See wikipedia for some information on the quite interesting Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

One of the unsolved problems in mathematics is:
_"Does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values?"_
